Issues in runManager folder

1. not able to fetch my output.json on the first time execution, but on the second time i am getting it.
   Error- on the first execution it's says output.json file not present but it actually created and it's not able to fetch before the        second function execution present in runSheetManager.ts.
   I have called the first function in the sample.ts
   and the json file for the second function has been called from test.ts
   
2. I have created and able to run and make changes for the one folder only example- alok
   but no idea how to execute my code for different folders like alok, prajakta, ritvik and so on...
